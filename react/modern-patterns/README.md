## Overview

Modern React development has evolved beyond traditional client-side rendering. These patterns enable:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Render components on the server for better performance and SEO
- **Progressive Loading**: Stream content as it becomes available
- **Improved Performance**: Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size
- **Better User Experience**: Provide smooth loading states and error handling

These patterns work best with modern React frameworks like Next.js 13+ with the App Router.
