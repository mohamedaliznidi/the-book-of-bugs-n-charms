## Ancient Overview

Modern React development has evolved beyond traditional client-side rendering rituals. These mystical patterns enable:

- **Server-Side Manifestation**: Render enchantments on the server for better performance and SEO divination
- **Progressive Loading Magic**: Stream mystical content as it becomes available through the ethereal realm
- **Enhanced Performance Spells**: Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size through magical optimization
- **Superior User Experience**: Provide smooth loading states and error handling through protective enchantments

These mystical patterns work best with modern React frameworks like Next.js 13+ with the App Router portal magic.
