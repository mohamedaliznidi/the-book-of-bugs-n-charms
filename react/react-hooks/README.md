# React Mystical Hooks Grimoire

Welcome to the sacred collection of React's most powerful enchantments! Here's a mystical catalog of commonly used React hooks, each with their arcane descriptions:

1. [**useState**](usestate.md): The State Preservation Spell - Allows functional enchantments to manage mystical state by providing a state variable and a spell to update it. Returns a pair of magical values: the current state and a transformation spell to modify it.

2. [**useEffect**](useeffect.md): The Side Effect Sorcery - Enables performing mystical side effects in functional enchantments. This spell runs after every render and replaces ancient lifecycle rituals like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

3. [**useContext**](usecontext.md): The Context Communion Spell - Provides a way to commune with React context within a functional enchantment. It allows accessing mystical values provided by a Context.Provider higher up in the enchantment tree.

4. [**useReducer**](usereducer.md): The Complex State Alchemy - An alternative to useState for managing more intricate state transformations. It accepts a reducer spell and initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch ritual to trigger state metamorphosis.

5. [**useCallback**](usecallback.md): The Function Preservation Charm - Memoizes a spell, returning a preserved version that only changes when mystical dependencies shift. Helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-enchantments.

6. [**useMemo**](usememo.md): The Value Crystallization Spell - Crystallizes a value, recalculating only when dependencies transform. Useful for optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary mystical computations.

7. [**useRef**](useref.md): The Reference Anchor Enchantment - Creates a mutable reference object whose .current property holds the mystical essence. The returned object persists throughout the enchantment's entire lifetime.

8. [**useLayoutEffect**](uselayouteffect.md): The Synchronous Effect Ritual - Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after all DOM transmutations. Perfect for measuring DOM nodes or performing actions requiring synchronous updates before browser repainting.

9. [**useImperativeHandle**](useimperativehandle.md): The Parent Exposure Spell - Customizes the mystical essence exposed to parent enchantments when using forwardRef. Allows child enchantments to reveal specific magical functionality to their ancestors.

10. [**useDebugValue**](usedebugvalue.md): The Debug Divination Charm - Provides mystical insight for custom hooks in React DevTools. Aids in debugging by displaying additional arcane information about custom enchantments.

These mystical hooks form the backbone of React functional enchantments, enabling sorcerers to manage state, perform side effects, optimize performance, and integrate with context and references seamlessly.
